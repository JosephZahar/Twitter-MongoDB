# Twitter-MongoDB
The task is to download, modify and insert a few tweets into a MongoDB database and then run simple mongo queries against the newly created database. We assume that your docker environment is ready; if not, please see the instructions in Week 1. The MongoDB data can be loaded either through the Twitter API or through Mongo Express using the provided Twitter data.
